This is a perso knowledge upgrade of my expertise on Low Latency computation with C++14 (with GCC 5.3)

- Type deduction (auto, decltype, type erasure)
- Initializer & nullptr
- Inheritance
- Constexpr & static_assert
- Thread & local
- Threads & Conditional variables (Circular Printer example)
- Threads & Futures & promisses (funny design of Circular Printer example)
- Threads & atomics (fences)
